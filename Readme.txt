# Weather Analysis System

This project is a Python-based weather analysis system designed for managing weather data and providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for data analysis. The system consists of two primary files: `Days.py` and `gui.py`.

## Overview

### `Days.py`
The `Days.py` file serves as the backbone of the weather analysis system, containing two essential classes: `Days` and `Day`. The `Days` class manages weather data for multiple cities and provides various methods for data analysis and retrieval. On the other hand, the `Day` class encapsulates individual weather data points with specific attributes.

### `gui.py`
The `gui.py` file complements the functionality of the `Days.py` file by offering a user-friendly graphical interface (GUI) using the PySimpleGUI library. It acts as an intermediary between users and the weather data management functionalities provided by the `Days` class.

## Functionalities

### `Days` Class
- Manages weather data efficiently for multiple cities.
- Offers methods for retrieving city names, adding new weather data points, calculating average temperature, total precipitation, plotting temperature trends, and generating correlation matrices.

### `gui.py`
- Provides a GUI interface for users to interact with weather data.
- Allows querying specific weather information, generating visual plots, performing statistical analysis, and deriving insights from the weather dataset.

## Usage

1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Ensure Python 3.x is installed.
   - Install required dependencies: `PySimpleGUI`.

2. **Run the Application**
   - Run the `gui.py` file using Python: `python gui.py`.
   - Follow the instructions in the GUI to interact with the weather analysis system.
